# MBQC - Measurement Based Quantum Computing

## What is MBQC?
Instead of using unitary evolution as it works in "unitary" quantum computing in MBQC we use projective measurements as evolution.

Steps in MBQC:
	- Make cluster state from your qubits
	- Generate sequence of measurements that replicate circuit
	- Follow this sequence of measurements
